# Sasha's dotfiles

These are my UNIX-y configuration files, known colloquially as "dotfiles"
because most of them begin with a period (a "dot"). These configurations are
used in MacOS, so some may not be applicable or may not work properly at all in
other environments. Most should work in flavors of Linux, though.

Important note: These are my personal configuration files, which are in a
constant state of change as I develop my environment across several systems.
I can't guarantee that these configurations will work for you, at all,
so if you encounter problems with them, you're pretty much on your own.

## Usage

Usage is straightforward.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/sasha7/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
```

## TODO
* provide a handy bash script that will handle process of symlinking configurations
into home directory
